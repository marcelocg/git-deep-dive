# Git Deep Dive

= Why?

Martial arts need exercise to be perfect. Why we think coding doesn't need it? Welcome to dojo (training room) for coding!

= How?

People work TOGETHER on one problem, one code sandbox. One person starts coding, speaks what he/she is doing. After 5 minutes, another person comes to spotlight, cycling all involved people.

Everybody is allowed to do ANYTHING, including deleting all code etc.

The task is to solve the problem.
